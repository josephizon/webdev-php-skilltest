2. After downloading XAMPP, open the XAMPP Control Panel and run the _Apache_ and _MySQL_ services.
3. From there, you can add these files into a folder inside the _htdocs_ folder where XAMPP is installed.
4. To run the website, just go to your browser and type in _localhost/[name_of_folder]_ then it will load up the website.
